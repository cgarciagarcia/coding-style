## Custom PhpStan rules
This section will list all the custom phpstan rules this package adds.

### Generic
Rules that are applied to all projects.

#### DeclareStrictTypes
This rule is used to ensure that all PHP files include with the `declare(strict_types=1)` statement.

#### NamespaceBasedSuffix
Sets up configuration for suffixing the following namespaces

- `App\Events`: `Event`
- `App\Listener`: `Listener`
- `App\Policies`: `Policy`
- `App\Jobs`: `Job`

This makes sures events, listeners, policies and jobs has the same suffix.

### Laravel
Rules that are only applied in a Laravel context.

#### DisallowPartialRouteFacadeResource
This rule disallows the usage of the `Route::resource` method when combined with `only` or `except`. Instead, 
partial route resources should be split into multiple routes.

#### DisallowPartialRouteFacadeResource
Similar to `DisallowPartialRouteFacadeResource`, but prevents partial resource usage when used in a route group.

#### DisallowPHPUnit
This rule prevents PHPUnit tests in favour of Pest PHP. It will allow abstract `TestCase` classes.

#### EnforceKebabCaseArtisanCommandsRule
This rule will enforce the use of kebab-case for Artisan commands.


## Custom sniffs
List all the custom sniffs created by Worksome.

### Laravel
All custom sniffs specific to Laravel.

#### Config filename kebab case
Checks if all config files are written in kebab case.

#### Disallow env usage
Makes sure that you don't use `env` helper in your code, except for config files.

#### Event listener suffix
Enforces event listeners to end with a specific suffix, this suffix is defaulted to `Listener`.

| parameters | defaults |
| --- | ---  |
| suffix | Listener |

#### Disallow blade outside of the `resources` directory
Makes sure no `.blade.php` files exist outside of Laravel's `resources` directory.

| parameters | defaults |
| --- | ---  |
| resourcesDirectory | {YOUR_PROJECT}/resources |

### PhpDoc
All custom sniffs which are not specific to Laravel.

#### Property dollar sign
Makes sure that you always have a dollar sign in your properties defined in phpdoc.
```php
/**
* @property string $name
 */
class User {}
```

### Param tags with no type or comment
This removes all `@param` tags which has no specified a type or comment
```php
/**
 * @param string $name
 * @param $type some random type
 * @param $other // <-- will be removed
 */
public function someMethod($name, $type, $other): void
{}
```


This is mainly because phpstan requires this before it sees the property as valid.
