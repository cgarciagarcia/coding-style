## Custom PhpStan rules
This section will list all the custom phpstan rules this package adds.

### Generic
Rules that are applied to all projects.

#### DeclareStrictTypes
This rule is used to ensure that all PHP files include with the `declare(strict_types=1)` statement.

#### NamespaceBasedSuffix
Sets up configuration for suffixing the following namespaces

- `App\Events`: `Event`
- `App\Listener`: `Listener`
- `App\Policies`: `Policy`
- `App\Jobs`: `Job`

This makes sures events, listeners, policies and jobs has the same suffix.

### Laravel
Rules that are only applied in a Laravel context.

#### DisallowAppHelperUsage
This rule disallows the usage of laravel's `app` helper function in favour of using dependency injection instead.

#### DisallowPartialRouteFacadeResource
This rule disallows the usage of the `Route::resource` method when combined with `only` or `except`. Instead, 
partial route resources should be split into multiple routes.

#### DisallowPartialRouteFacadeResource
Similar to `DisallowPartialRouteFacadeResource`, but prevents partial resource usage when used in a route group.

#### DisallowPHPUnit
This rule prevents PHPUnit tests in favour of Pest PHP. It will allow abstract `TestCase` classes.

#### EnforceKebabCaseArtisanCommandsRule
This rule will enforce the use of kebab-case for Artisan commands.
